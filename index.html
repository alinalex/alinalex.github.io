                <p>I’m a self-taught front-end developer/web developer/programmer from Europe doing front-end development <a href="http://http://www.ejump.ro/">@ejump</a>. My projects involve html5 css3 jQuery worpress php and photoshop.</p>

                <p>My life story starts when my parents bought me my first lego. Since then I have loved to make stuff (happen) and I kept seeking for a craft that would allow me to do that.</p>

                <p>I decided to give another shot to my seeking adventure and last year I quit my job to learn how to program by my own (you can read the full story on medium). Fast forward 10 months after that and I had the AHA moment while reading a book while riding the subway. Basically, I have loved solving problems for my entire life but it took me 24 years to realise that this is exactly what designers do.</p>

                <p>But, how did I get to quit my job and start learning programming? Well, my professional trajectory is quite unique (I have even been to US before I got into college at a FEE summer seminar). My background is in finance, I did some volunteering by organising a project for students, I have worked in the financial industry, I have also been into consultancy and I started a business with a friend of mine in the second year of college, which failed. For the long version you can check out <a href="#">my resume</a>.</p>

                <p>For the next years I want to broaden my design skills because I want to do UX and be a product designer.</p>

                <p>I love to read - taleb is one of my favourites - , playing tennis (mostly watching), listening to kendrick lamar songs, spending quality time with my better half and of course, to better my craft at designing stunning UI’s. </p>

                  <p class="medium">Why do I want to be an intern at Basecamp</p>
                  <p>i like the way you managed to envision a tool that help teams more than facilitating the chat between its members. Also, I resonate with the fact that you a have a customer centric design and a remote working vision (they even invented it - sa mai vb de asta si ca vreau sa ajung in state). I want to be at basecamp because I could have an impact on the educational system as you provide the service for free to teachers</p>

                  <p class="medium">What projects I'm interested in working on</p>
                  <p>I would love to be part of the project that involves the designing of improved workflows for your internal support tools and it would give me an opportunity to push my design skills limits. The second option would be to be part of Research and implement team for Trix</p>

                  <p class="medium">Why you should hire me</p>
                  <p>I am as Steve Jobs put it “stay foolish stay hungry”. I am foolish because I have just got into the industry and I think everything is possible and am I am hungry enough to learn and put the extra-hours that are needed to make what others say is impossible into possible. And the most important, I am able to adapt and learn on my own everything that interests me.</p>
